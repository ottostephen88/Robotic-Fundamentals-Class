# Robotic-Fundamentals-Class
## Midterm Project

## Final Project
The final project was to use kinematics and use Adams Software. I created a robotic arm that could feed a person at a table. The robotic arm was modeled from SolidWorks and I used matlab to find the angles needed for the end effector to end up at certain positions.
A clip of the robot with the inputted angles is shown in Adams Software.
